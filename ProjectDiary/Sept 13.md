# Week 2

The topic "Fake News Detection" was selected and presented in the 0th presentation.

### Abstract
The rapid increase of misleading information in everyday access media platforms such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers have made it challenging to identify trustworthy news sources, thus increasing the need for computational tools able to provide insights into the reliability of online content. In this project, we focus on the automatic identification of fake content in online news. Two implementation levels of this project includes creating new datasets for the task of fake news detection, covering several different news domains and conducting a set of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors.
