#### Automatically Identifying Fake News in Popular Twitter Threads

This work demonstrates an automated system for detecting fake news in popular Twitter threads. Furthermore, leveraging non-expert, crowdsourced workers rather than journalists provides a useful and less expensive means to classify true and false stories on Twitter rapidly. Such a system could be valuable to social media users by augmenting and supporting their own credibility judgements, which would be a crucial boon given the known weaknesses users exhibit in these judgements. These results may also be of value in studying propaganda on social media to determine whether such stories follow similar patterns.

#### Automatic Online Fake News Detection Combining Content and Social Signals

In the context of social networks, machine learning (ML) methods can be used for this purpose. Fake news detection strategies are traditionally either based on content analysis (i.e. analyzing the content of the news) or - more recently - on social context models, such as mapping the newsâ€™ diffusion pattern. This paper proposes a novel ML fake news detection method which, by combining news content and social context features, outperforms existing methods in the literature, increasing their already high accuracy by up to 4.8%.
