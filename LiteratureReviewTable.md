| Automatically Identifying Fake News in Popular Twitter Threads | Cody Buntain; Jennifer Golbeck | CREDBANK Dataset, PHEME Rumor Dataset, Buzzfeed News Fact-Checking Dataset | Features for predicting accuracy, Dataset alignment, Per-set Feature Selection | Models trained against non-expert, crowdsourced workers outperform models trained against journalists in classifying popular news stories on Twitter as true or fake, the limited predictive feature overlap in PHEME and CREDBANK suggest these populations evaluate accuracy in social media differently |
| Media-Rich Fake News Detection: A Survey | Shivam B. Parikh and Pradeep K. Atrey | BuzzFeedNews, LIAR, PHEME, CREDBANK | Linguistic Features based Methods, Deception Modeling based Methods, Clustering based Methods, Predictive Modeling based Methods | Presents an insight on characterization of news story in the modern diaspora combined with the differential content types of news story and its impact on readers |
| Weakly Supervised Learning for Fake News Detection on Twitter | Stefan Helmstetter; Heiko Paulheim | Facebook Dataset, Twitter Dataset, Large-scale Training Dataset and Small-scale Evaluation Dataset | Weakly supervised model | Achieving an F1 score of 0.77 when only taking into account a tweet as such, and up to 0.9 when also including information about the user account |
